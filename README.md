# Analyze-medical-appointment-data-
The purpose of this report is to analyze medical appointment data to identify factors influencing no-show rates. The data used comes from a CSV file titled "KaggleV2-May-2016.csv," which contains various information about patients, their appointments, and some of their medical characteristics.
What particularly interests me in this dataset is understanding why some patients do not show up for their appointments and what factors may influence this behavior
